## Software Development Plan for BeiCoin Project  

### 1. Requirements Analysis and Planning  
- Define core features of the BeiCoin ecosystem, focusing on token creation, ledger functionality, and transaction tracking.  
- Identify stakeholdersâ€™ needs (alumni, students, school administrators).  
- Determine technical requirements for Solana smart contracts and front-end integration.  

### 2. Smart Contract Development  
- **Functions to Develop**:  
  - Token Creation: Mint, burn, and transfer tokens.  
  - Ledger Management: Record and display transaction history.  
  - Wallet Integration: Handle user wallets for deposits, withdrawals, and balances.  
  - Governance Tools: Allow school administrators to allocate or manage tokens (e.g., scholarships).  
  - Reward System: Automate token distribution for specific achievements or contributions.  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - `totalSupply`: Tracks the total number of BeiCoins.  
  - `balances`: Maps user addresses to their token holdings.  
  - `transactions`: Stores records of all transactions with timestamps.  
  - `admin`: Identifies authorized accounts for governance.  

### 3. Front-End Development  
- **User Interface (UI)**:  
  - Develop a web-based dashboard for students, alumni, and administrators.  
  - Include features for viewing token balances, initiating transactions, and tracking contributions.  
- **Integration**:  
  - Connect the front-end to the Solana blockchain via APIs or SDKs.  
  - Ensure real-time updates of wallet balances and transaction status.  

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance  
- Test smart contract functionality with simulated transactions.  
- Conduct front-end user testing to validate usability and performance.  
- Ensure security audits of smart contracts to protect user funds.  

### 5. Deployment and User Training  
- Deploy smart contracts on the Solana mainnet.  
- Launch the front-end application for stakeholders.  
- Provide tutorials or guides for users to access wallets, view balances, and engage in transactions.  

### 6. Maintenance and Upgrades  
- Monitor performance, fix bugs, and optimize smart contracts as needed.  
- Roll out updates to support new features or address user feedback.

## Personal Story Summary  

As a new student at Bei School, I was inspired by the schoolâ€™s legacy of innovation and its alumniâ€™s success. Yet, I noticed a disconnect: while alumni achieved great wealth, the school struggled to support its students and programs. Determined to bridge this gap, I envisioned BeiCoinâ€”a digital token on the Solana blockchain to connect alumni, students, and contributors. Working with a passionate team, we developed a transparent, decentralized ledger to empower the community and ensure lasting resources for future generations. BeiCoin became more than a project; it was a mission to create meaningful, sustainable impact.
